# MyDash

This is really just my exploration of [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed)
and [blessed-contrib](https://github.com/yaronn/blessed-contrib) in an attempt
to build a UI with JavaScript without using a browser window. My typical browser 
tab count is somewhere between ridiculous and stupid, so if I need to write a
personal dashboard that I'm going to be able to find easily, it can't be in a
browser. 

Here's the start of my project, I'll add more soon.

## installing the code

```
node install
```

## running the code

```
LANG=en_US.utf8 TERM=xterm-256color node mydash.js
```
